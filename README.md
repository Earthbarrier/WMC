hi

i'm not a SWE

if you read the code you'll probably think im an idiot

but just put pdfs in "input_papers" and from /WMD run ./RUN.

you'll need to set your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY environment variables. it needs both because claude does pictures better but openai has a better tts model (or any at all?)

if a figure is highly detailed, tick the "detailed figure" checkbox, add the full figure first, and then add the individual panels. then once youre done with that figure, untick the "detailed figure" checkbox, this signals to the program to start a new figure
this is poor code and ill probably fix it eventually. if you're not using "detailed figure" for that figure you dont have to worry about that step. anyway once you've collected all of the figures in the paper, hit save figures and close the window manually. if you have multiple pdfs in the input folder, the next paper will pop up so you can frontload the human input steps.

note: pay attention to your openai bill, the tts model can get expensive. also Offline Music Player by Md Zakir Hossain is a great app for iPhone if you wanna listen to these on your phone and it syncs really well with google drive.

hope it helps
